This world is beautiful
Held within its stars
I keep it in my heart
The stars are your eyes
I loved them right from the start
A world so beautiful
And I keep it
In my heart

A ghosteen dances in my hand
Slowly twirling, twirling, all around
Glowing circle in my hand
Dancing, dancing, dancing, all around

A ghosteen dances in my hand
Slowly twirling, twirling, all around
A ghosteen dances in my hand
Dancing, dancing, dancing, all around

There goes the moonlit man
Got a suitcase in his hand
He’s moving on down the road
Things tend to fall apart
Starting with his heart
He kisses you lightly and he leaves
Leaves your sleeping body
Curled and dreaming around your smile
Around your smile

The three bears watch the TV
They age a lifetime, O Lord
Mama Bear holds the remote
Papa Bear he just floats
And Baby Bear he has gone
Gone to the moon in a boat
Oh in a boat

I’m speaking about love now
How the lights of love go down
You’re in the back room washing his clothes
Love’s like that you know
It’s like a tidal flow
And the past with its fierce undertow
Won’t ever let us go
Won’t ever let you go

If I could move the night I would
And I would turn the world around if I could
There is nothing wrong with loving something
You can’t hold in your hand
You’re sitting on the edge of the bed
Smoking and shaking your head
Well there’s nothing wrong with loving things
That cannot even stand

Well, there goes your moony man
With his suitcase in his hand
Every road is lined with animals
That rise from their blood and walk
Well  the moon won’t get a wink of sleep
If I stay all night and talk
If I stay all night and talk
